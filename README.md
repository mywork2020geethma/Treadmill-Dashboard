# Treadmill-Dashboard

Project Overview
In this project, the goal is to develop a program that provides useful insights to a treadmill user based on the operational conditions of the treadmill. The program is designed to calculate and display key metrics such as speed, distance walked/ran, calories burnt, and the number of steps taken. These insights are essential for tracking the user's workout progress and performance.

The system allows users to input various operational parameters, which are provided in different units. The program automatically handles the necessary unit conversions to ensure accurate calculations. The following inputs are accepted by the program:

Rate of motor rotation (given in RPM)
Radius of the motor shaft (accepted in meters, centimeters, or inches)
Weight and height of the person (accepted in kilograms or pounds for weight, and meters, centimeters, or inches for height)
Time duration of the workout (accepted in seconds, minutes, or hours)
The program performs calculations based on these parameters and outputs the results in the following format:

Speed (in meters per second)
Distance (in meters)
Calories burnt (in calories)
Number of steps taken (as an integer count)
